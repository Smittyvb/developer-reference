# Nimiq Blockchain
[Nimiq](https://nimiq.com/) is a frictionless payment protocol for the web. For a high-level introduction please read the [Nimiq White Paper](https://medium.com/nimiq-network/nimiq-a-peer-to-peer-payment-protocol-native-to-the-web-ffd324bb084). The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nimiq-network/core).

This developer reference contains:

* [Data Schemas](#data-schemas)

Data schemas as used on the wire, focusing on fields, bytes sizes and short explanations.

* [Transactions](chapters/transactions.md): basic and extended
* [Blockchain](chapters/block.md): block, header, interlink, body
* [Accounts and Contracts](chapters/accounts-and-contracts.md): basic account, vesting and hashed time-locked contracts
* [Accounts Tree](chapters/account-tree.md): details on the Patricia Merkle Tree used to store accounts
* [Primitives](chapters/primitives.md): none-composed elements, e.g. hashes, addresses
* [Messages](chapters/messages.md): All p2p-related inter-node messages

## High Level Concepts

* [Constants](chapters/constants.md): Configuration of the Nimiq core
* [Nodes and Clients](chapters/nodes-and-clients.md): Node.js and browser, full, small, and nano
* [Supply and Reward](chapters/supply-and-reward.md): total supply, rewards, difficulty adjustment
* [Verification](chapters/verify.md): Validation rules for the Nimiq Blockchain

We believe in communicating our concepts and approaches as clearly as possible. The easier it is to dive into the details, the more people will do it, again resulting in a deeper peer-reviewing process which is essential for the hardening of our protocol.
